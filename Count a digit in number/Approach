Approach: 
Store the integer in a variable X and initialize a counter variable to count the number of digits.
We know that in programming languages when we divide X by Y it will result in an integer (given both the variables are integers). For example, 133/10 will result in 13 similarly 1/10 will result in 0.
Using a for loop and above observation keep on dividing X by 10 and increment the count in every iteration when X equals 0 terminate the loop and the count will have the number of digits in N.
