// Approach
// Our main task is to determine the locations of the nodes whose values are to be swapped. This can be done by traversing the list using two pointers - fast and slow, with a certain distance between them. The pointers move one node at a time. The distance should be chosen such that:

// when slow is at head, fast points at the first node for swapping
// when fast is at the end, slow points at the second node for swapping
// Example
// Let's take this example:

// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 2
// It's easy to see that we have to swap 2 and 4. Let's implement that.

// We traverse this list with fast and slow.

// It is convenient to choose the initial position for slow to be at head, e.g. 1. If we choose fast to be k nodes after slow - at 3 - we miss the node 2. Therefore, we put fast k-1 nodes after slow. This means that the first node for swapping is at the initial position of fast.

// When fast is at 5, slow is at 4, which is the second node whose value will be swapped. In other words, we save the second node for swapping when fast reaches the last node (fast.next is null). For that, the distance between slow and fast must be constant; this is achieved by moving them both one node at a time until fast reaches the end.

// Algorithm
// Let's use two more pointers first and second, denoting the nodes for swapping

// Put slow at head, and put fast k-1 nodes after slow.
// first = fast.
// If fast isn't already at the last node, move slow and fast one node further until fast.next == null
// second = slow
// Swap the values of first and second
// Implementation




class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {		
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode first = head, second = head;
        
		// Put fast (k-1) nodes after slow
        for(int i = 0; i < k - 1; ++i)
            fast = fast.next;
            
		// Save the node for swapping
        first = fast;

		// Move until the end of the list
        while(fast.next != null) {
			slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next;
        }
        
        // Save the second node for swapping
		// Note that the pointer second isn't necessary: we could use slow for swapping as well
		// However, having second improves readability
        second = slow;
		
		// Swap values
        int temp = first.val;
        first.val = second.val;
        second.val = temp;
        
        return head;
    }
}




// Discussion
// We traverse the list only once, therefore the time complexity is O(n)
// We store only 4 pointers for every list; thus, the space complexity is constant: O(1)

// Update
// Keeping in mind the constraints 1 <= k <= n <= 105, the line if (head == null) isn't needed here, and while (fast != null && fast.next != null) can be replaced by a simple ``while (fast.next != null)```
